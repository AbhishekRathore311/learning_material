    "👋 Hi there! Custom functions 🛠️ are blocks of code created by programmers to perform specific tasks or operations within a program. They can be created in most programming languages and are often used to simplify and modularize code by separating out specific functions that can be called upon multiple times within the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom function 🧰 can be designed to take one or more input parameters 🎛️, which can be used to customize its behavior. These parameters allow the function to be called with different arguments, enabling it to perform the same operation on different sets of data 📊. The output of a function can also be customized, allowing it to return specific results based on its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of custom functions is that they can be reused ♻️ throughout a program or even across multiple programs 🌐. This reduces the amount of code that needs to be written, which can save time and effort 💪. Custom functions also make code easier to read and understand because they encapsulate complex operations in a single function with a clear name and purpose 🤓.\n",

    "Custom functions in Python are a way to group together instructions or algorithms to perform a specific task or operation. They offer modularity, abstraction, encapsulation, reusability, and parameterization, which simplifies writing, managing, and debugging code. Functions can be tailored to accommodate various input parameters and can be used across several programs or scripts. Through custom functions, developers can create more efficient, reusable ♻️, and adaptable 💪 code.\n",

    "Once upon a time, there was a 💻 programmer named Sarah who was working on a project that required a lot of repetitive tasks. She realized that writing the same code over and over again was not only ⏰time-consuming but also prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Sarah decided to create custom functions in Python to automate the repetitive tasks. She started by identifying the common patterns in the code and breaking them down into separate functions. She gave each function a clear name that reflected its purpose, making it easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧱 Sarah's custom functions allowed her to modularize her code and avoid duplicating it. She was able to write more efficient and readable code, as she could reuse the same functions across multiple parts of her program.\n",
    "\n",
    "With her custom functions, Sarah was also able to abstract away the complexity of the code, making it easier to understand and reason about. She parameterized her functions to make them adaptable to different inputs, giving her more flexibility and allowing her to create more reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to her custom functions, Sarah was able to complete her project on time and with fewer errors. She also realized that by creating reusable functions, she had made her code more adaptable for future projects. Sarah learned that creating custom functions was an essential skill for any 💻 programmer who wants to write efficient, readable, and maintainable code.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. 🔍 Keep your functions small and focused: Each function should have a single responsibility, making it easier to read, understand, and test.\n",
    "2. 🏷️ Use clear and descriptive names: Choose a name that accurately reflects what the function does, making it easier to use and maintain.\n",
    "3. 📝 Write docstrings: Use docstrings to describe the purpose, input parameters, and output of your function. This makes it easier for other developers to understand and use your code.\n",
    "4. 🛡️ Use default arguments: Use default arguments to make your functions more flexible and adaptable to different use cases.\n",
    "5. 🚫 Avoid global variables: Global variables can make it harder to debug and maintain your code. Instead, pass all necessary data as input parameters.\n",
    "6. 🙅‍♀️ Avoid side effects: A function should not modify any variables outside of its scope or have any side effects. This can make your code harder to reason about and debug.\n",
    "7. ✅ Test your functions: Create test cases for your functions to ensure that they work as expected and handle edge cases correctly.\n",
    "8. 🔁 Be consistent: Follow a consistent style throughout your code, including naming conventions, formatting, and variable naming.\n",

    "1. 🐌 Performance overhead: Depending on the complexity of the function and the amount of data being processed, using a custom function can sometimes result in slower execution times than writing the code inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 👀 Abstraction can be a double-edged sword: While abstraction can help make your code more modular and easier to understand, it can also make it harder to see the underlying implementation details and performance implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🕸️ Dependencies and compatibility issues: If you're using custom functions from external libraries or packages, you may run into issues with compatibility or versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🤖 Debugging can be tricky: If you're using a lot of custom functions in your code, it can be challenging to debug errors or trace the flow of data through your program.\n",
